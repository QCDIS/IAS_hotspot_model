# IAS Hotspot Model

## Summary 

<img src=images/frontpage3.jpg width=500 align=right>

The scripts in this repo are designed to use species distribution models (SDM) to identify potential high-risk areas for the introduction, establishment and spread of invasive species in European coastal water. The SDM workflow is based on a modeling workflow developed by University of Gothenburg (Leidenberger et al. 2015; Laugen et al. 2015; Stelzer et al. 2013; Karlsson et al. 2019) and was further adapted to model a large number of known invasive species. The models' results not only identify potential areas of distribution for individual species, but can also be used to map regions where suitable habitats for a large number of invasive species overlap. These superimposed maps can then further be integrated with external data layers on introduction vectors such as ship traffic density and oceanographic currents as well as with data on invasive impact for individual species. The integration of oceanographic data is however is not yet fully implemented. The regions identified in this workflow as areas with a high overall invasion risk (i.e. high risk of both introduction and establishment) can be considered invasive hotspots.

The workflow for running the analysis is written in R and was built under the commission of the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM) and was futher supported by the European project MARCO-BOLO (MARine COastal BiOdiversity Long-term Observations). It is formally part of the reports by Bergkvist et al (2020) and Obst & Andersson (2023). The repo contains all input and output data from the modelling experiments and is continuously developed further.

The original IAS hotspot model was expanded to predict suitable habitat in the northern Baltic Sea for invasive species originating from freshwater systems, i.e. lakes and rivers. This model is documented in the folder "Freshwater model for Bothnian sea".


## Mylifewatch 

To crated mylifewatch warps you need to run the wrapper library scripts. 
In the folder mylifewatch you can find the scripts to create the mylifewatch warps.
For example to create the mylifewatch warp 01_setup.R go to folder mylifewatch/01_setup and run the warper script:

Here we assume that the mylifewatch-wrapper-development-kit is in ~/workspace/mylifewatch-wrapper-development-kit

```bash
cd mylifewatch/SEanalysis/
~/workspace/mylifewatch-wrapper-development-kit/bin/build-image 
```

Next to test the warp you can run the following command:

```bash
~/workspace/mylifewatch-wrapper-development-kit/bin/execute
```
