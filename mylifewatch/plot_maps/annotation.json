  "description": "The rasterstack representing the area of interest is reloaded in memory. The function “plot maps” will run the random forests model on the raster. It returns the result as a raster with is then stored as an rda file. However, the function also makes some plots. The plots in the “plot maps” function could be inactivated to save time. However, it was useful to get the plots to see that the algorithm worked as intended.\n\nFor plotting the data different color plaettes are used using functions divpalette and seqpalette. Cutoffs are defined manually so that the color scale on the side will get a reasonable appearance and so that all species will be plotted with the same colorscale. In the end of the colorscale I add extra color for values outside the scale (that is land..)\n\nMaps ar plotted with linear probabilities and log10 probabilities. To avoid na´s I add a small number to the probabilities before logging.\n\nAfter transformation the predicted rasters are saved as geotiff rasters.",
